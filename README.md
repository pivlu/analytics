**[Pivlu Analytics](https://analytics.pivlu.com) is an open source, privacy-friendly and lightweight web analytics alternative to Google Analytics.**

## A better alternative for Google Analytics
Google Analytics is difficult to understand and use, slow to load and privacy-invasive. It takes time to understand and requires training. We built Pivlu Analytics, a simple but powerful alternative.

## No need for GDPR consent or cookie banner.
Pivlu Analytics doesnâ€™t use cookies and is fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA and PECR. 
No personal data is collected and there are no persistent identifiers. Your site data is not used for any other purposes. 

## Data ownership of your web visitors
By using Pivlu Analytics, you protect the privacy of your visitors and keep ownership of your website data. You can self-host Pivlu Analytics on your own server. 

If you are using our hosted service (cloud), your data remain completely in control of your website and you own all of your data too. 


Pivlu Analytics is build using Laravel Framework.
